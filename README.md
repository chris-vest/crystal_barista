# crystal_barista

Some variations from the sample which is kindly provided by the Barista maintainer:

1) Only using mdi icons, I didn't want to have to mix and match all the icons, it seemed unnecesasry
2) Removed the Google (EvilCorp) integration
3) Removed the weather integration (I can look out the window...)
